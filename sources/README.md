## <img src="assets/icons/intro.png" height="30" align="top"/> Introduction



Large language models have evolved from single-turn chatbots into the decision-making core of autonomous agents. As Figure 1 shows, the time horizon of tasks they can complete unaided is growing exponentially. This surfaces one decisive requirement we call **long horizon**: persistent iteration across reasoning, tool use, observation, and revision over many interdependent steps — from tasks within a single context window to those spanning windows, sessions, or open-ended task streams.

Our survey frames **long-horizon agency** as a system-level capability jointly shaped by two forces:

- **Externalized harness engineering**: loops and workflows, context and memory, tools and skills, orchestration, hooks, and verification.
- **Internalized model optimization**: architecture, data and environment synthesis, pre-/mid-training, fine-tuning, agentic reinforcement learning, on-policy distillation, and self-evolution.

The two sides co-evolve through experience and feedback: capabilities first implemented explicitly in the harness may later be internalized into the model policy, while stronger policies in turn enable more capable harnesses. Figure 2 lays out this co-evolutionary landscape end to end.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/sec2_foundations.png" width="90%" alt="Three levels of long-horizon tasks and capabilities"/>
<br>
<em><b>Section figure.</b> Three levels of long-horizon tasks (H1 ⊂ H2 ⊂ H3) and their required capabilities (C1 ⊂ C2 ⊂ C3).</em>
</div>

<br>

We formalize a long-horizon agent as a base policy coupled to a surrounding harness, $\mathrm{Agent}=\pi_\theta\oplus\mathcal{H}$, and organize long-horizon difficulty into **three nested levels (H1 ⊂ H2 ⊂ H3)**, each paired with the capability it demands (C1 ⊂ C2 ⊂ C3):

| Level | Task horizon | Demanded capability |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| **H1** | Intra-context, within one window (~minutes) | **C1** — Intra-context interactive reasoning |
| **H2** | Cross-context, across windows/sessions (~hours–days) | **C2** — Cross-context state & memory |
| **H3** | Cross-task, open-ended task stream | **C3** — Cross-task experience accumulation |

To make the notion of "horizon" concrete, [METR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14499) measures capability as the length of tasks an agent can complete at a fixed success rate (e.g., the 50%-task-completion time horizon), giving an empirical yardstick that separates long-horizon agency from adjacent notions such as long-running execution, autonomy, and self-evolution.

## <img src="assets/icons/frontier.png" height="30" align="top"/> Frontiers: Open Problems

We group open problems into **four axes** spanning nine concrete directions. A recurring thread: the *harness*, not the model alone, is where much of the next advance must happen.

| Axis | Frontier | Core open challenge |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **I. Evolution** | Self-evolving harness & agents | Objective is a hand-set metric; gains stay in-distribution; long runs overfit/drift |
| | Harness transferability | Models bind to one harness; rankings swing across providers; no standard protocol |
| | Continual & lifelong learning | External memory is shallow; internal updates risk forgetting |
| **II. Effectiveness** | Real-world environment interaction | No direct training in live systems; synthesis & world-models face a fidelity test |
| | From digital to embodied agents | Timescale conflict; physics/dimensionality gap; coarse-vs-fine feedback |
| **III. Efficiency** | Cost- & budget-aware agency | Budget-blind; no calibrated cost sense; no runtime ceilings; no budget↔success law |
| | Multimodal & omni harness | Multimodality bolted on; heuristic visual-token budgeting; unreliable cross-modal verification |
| **IV. Trustworthiness** | Reflection & error robustness | Late failure detection; unreliable intrinsic self-correction; errors compound into goal drift |
| | Safety & governance | Injected error/hazardous experience reuse; no unified safety standard; self-evolution erodes invariants |

## <img src="assets/icons/contributing.png" height="30" align="top"/> Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! Please open a Pull Request to add a missing paper or fix a link. When adding a work, keep the per-line format consistent:

```
- **`Venue Year`** Title. [[paper](URL)] [[code](URL)]
```

Guidelines:
- Prefer the **acceptance venue** (e.g., `ICML 2024`, `NeurIPS 2023`, `ICLR 2025`); use `arXiv YYYY` only when a work has no conference venue.
- Place each paper under the subsection that best matches its **primary** contribution.
- Prioritize representative, high-impact works to keep each list readable.
